What Madox says of the series of Great Rolls of the Pipe, that
it is adocument of pre-eminent dignity, the most stately record

On the whole, either series cannot but be regarded as a
national document of supreme interest, as well on account of
the curiosity and importance of many of the numberless
facts which are here recorded, and the character of unim-
peachable authenticity under which those facts come down
to uS, as of the remoteness of the period to which the earlier
rolls relate, a period from which little that is documentary
has descended to our time, to. vcorroborate or. to-refute the
statements of the chronicleS.

The great importance to all. the enquirers into the minute
and curious points of our early. history of having easy access
to this great depositoryof sound information, and a sense of
the value of these documents as elucidatory of many points
in our constitutional history, have determined the Commis-
sioners on the Public Records to order the publication„ of
many of the earlier rolls in one of the two serieses. They
have selected the T reasurer’s series„ or the Great Rolls of the
Pipe, as the series of superior¹ dignity, and the rolls for the
reign of Henry II. and his sons are now in a course of
transcription for the press. They, have thought it, however,
expedient to order also the transcription of a few of the rolls
