2. Instances of partial or complete discharges being entered
in the Treasurer's roll while they are not found in the
Chancellor’s, occur in respect of Wido de Crean (Croun in

fil. Reinerii, p. 102; of wido fil. Roberti, p. 124 ; ofRicardus

the name of the wood, which was Haldanebi, on which the

p. 40, was under Burkesoure; and the xv. li. to Henr. fil.
Coffi, p. 90, was in Liscaret. The names of the associates
