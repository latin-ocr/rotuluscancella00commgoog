in the Chancellor's serieS, and to publish one of them. The
roll selected is that of the Sd of King John, not on account
of any peculiar curiosity belonging to it, but of the greater
facilities of access which were afforded to it for the purpose
of transcription or collation, than were at that time afforded
either to the great mass of the Chancellor’s rolls or to the
rolls of the Treasurer at the Pipe Office. They have found,
on comparison with the correspondent roll of the Treasurer’s
series, that this roll is in a far more perfect state of preservae
tion, supplying numerous passages where the Treasurer’s roll
is decayed and illegible.

The degree of correspondency between the Treasurer's
and the Chancellor's roll is a point of no little curiosity.
Certain it is that if we may judge of the rest by the roll
which is here printed, the correspondency is not so exact as
the old writer on the Court of Exchequer maintains that
it was the duty of the. Chancellor’s scribe to observe. Certain
it is that there are some entries on the Treasurer’s roll which
are not found at all on the Chancellor’s; and that in some
instances the information is more extended‚ as the same
transactionis entered on the roll of the Treasurer. There
are also a few, though very few, variations between them.
Acquittances in whole or in part appear in some instances on
one roll, and not on the other. Mr. Devon, the officer of the
Chapter House who transcribed the Chancellor’s Roll which
is here printed, has taken the pains to collate it with the
Treasurer's Roll at the Pipe office, and from his notes the
following abstract is made of the more material of the
variations between them.
