xii PREFACE.

There is no discoverable general principle to which we
can refer these variations: neither is there in respect of
another class of variations ; for,

5. There are about twelve entries on the Treasurer's roll,
which do not appear at all on that of the Chancellor. One
of these is an agreement between the Prior of Coventry and
Warin de Snipeston, for which the Prior paid half a mark to
have it inscribed in the Great Roll: but the entries are in
general of matters in the ordinary course of the proceedings
of the court.

6. In a very few instances the entries on the two rolls
are at variance with each other. In the remarkable entry
respecting Earl Patrick‚ p. 62, the Treasurer’s roll has the
word ne or non between Pat³ci9 and reddidit. The licence to the
Earl of Warwick, p. 6, has remanendi in both Rolls, as written
prima manu ; but in the Treasurer’s roll the word is changed
to redeundi. The entries respecting the Earl of Clare, p. 152,
and Philip de Sandrevile, p. 262, have the line of obliteration
in the Treasurer’s roll; while, at p.l92, we have a passage re-
lating to Adam de Middleton and otherS, which is marked as
obliterated only in the Chancellor’s roll, and the reason is
given, that they answer in the county of Lancaster.

On the whole, it appears from Mr. Devon's collation'that·
the Treasurer’s roll contains several matters of greater or less
interest, which are not to be found on the Chancellor'S, and
that it appears to have been prepared originally with somewhat
more care3 while in point of preservation the advantage is
greatly in favour of the Chancellor’s roll, which has suffered
very little damage in its descent through more than six ce'n-
turies, while in the Treasurer's roll many passages are become
illegible, or the part of the membrane which contained them

has wholly perished.
