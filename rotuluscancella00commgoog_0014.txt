PREFACE. vii

The Chaucellor’s series is far less complete. These rolla
being regarded as of secondary importance, and as, in fact,
(which aster a time they really became,) but transcripts from
existing originals, less care was taken of the preservation of
them, and many there is reason to believe are now irrecover-
ably lost. Under the direction of the Commission‚ however,
searches have been made for the Chaucellor’s roIIS, and
many, the existence of which was before unknown, have
been recovered, from amongst the unsorted Records in the
the custody of the Clerk of the Pipe.

The Chaucellor’s rolls not being required to be produced
in evidence when there is the Treasurer’s roll to be exhibited,
an opportunity was afforded of opening this source of his-
torical information to the public, of which the Commission
has availed itself. By their desire, and with the consent of
the Deputy Clerk of the Pipe, these rolls, as they have been
discovered and cleaned, have been sent to the British
Museum, where they may now be consulted- by the historical
enquirer in the same manner as the other manuscripts in
that great national depositary.

The whole number of Chaucellor’s rolls which have been
sent to the Museum, up to the present month, October, 1833,
is two hundred and ninety-three, lying between the llth of
Henry IL, the earliest of these rolls ,hitherto discovered,
and the l7th year of King James Ι. One roll, namely, that
of the 7th of Henry IV. is retained in the antient custody,
to supply the place of the lost Treasurer’s roll of that year.

Three roHS, which are reasonably supposed to belong to
the Chaucellor’s serieS, became separated from the rest at
some remote and unknown period. Two of them, namely,
those of the 6th of Richard Ι. and the 7th of John, are

amongst the public Records in the Tower of London. The
