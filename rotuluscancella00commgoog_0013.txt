was Scriptor Rotuli de Cancellaria. He was to the Chan-
cellor what the other scribe was to the Treasurer3 and though
the Chancellor did not sit near him, the seat of that eminent
officer being at the first table, yet he had a clerk of the Chan-
cellor at his side who was to . watch his proceedings‚ and
to see that the Chancellor’s roll corresponded precisely with
that of the Treasurer. The old writer on the Court of
Exchequer, Gervase of Tilbury, or Richard Fitz Nigel, from
whom these particulars are collected, says that the correspon-
dency wasto be most exactz-ut nec iota unum desit nec
alius sit ordo scribendi!

At the hands of both these scribes we receive a series of
annual accomptS.

The rolls which were prepared by the Scriptor Rotuli de
Thesauro are those now known by the appellation of the Pipe
Rolls, or the Great Rolls of the ΗΡΘ. These are the rolls ⁸
which are usually meant whenever reference is made to the
Rotuli Annales of the Exchequer. The series commences
with the second year of King Henry IL, and is nearly com-
plete to the present time. When the existing Commission on
the Public Records first directed its attention on this noble
national document, it was found that thirteen of the rolls
were missing. Orders were immediately given that strict
searches should be instituted in all the depositories of the
Exchequer Records. The issue has been that eleven of the
lost rolls have been recovered, so that now two only are ¹
wanting to complete a series which extends through a period
of six hundred and seventy-seven years. The two which
have not been found are of the lst of Henry III. and the

7th of Henry IV.
