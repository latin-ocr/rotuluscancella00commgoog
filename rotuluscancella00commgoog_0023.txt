considerable time in this year the residence of the Queenand
her household ; and finally, of various houses belonging to
the King‚ in which he occasionally resided, of which this roll
contains the mention of the King’s houses at Guildford,
Canock in Staffordshire, Northampton, Bruge5‚ Havering,
where was also a park and chapel‚ Berkhamstede, Dorchester,
Woodstock, Windsor, and winchester.

The nature of a Preface such as this admits but of a slight
and faint sketch of the abundant historical materials to be
found in this Roll. Besides the topics already adverted to,
it will be found to contain something that will illustrate the
state of society in those early timeS, in its notices of the prices
of provisions or of other commodities3 the expences of transit,
the various kinds of money used in currency or for accompt;
licences and other transactions connected with the chace ς and
in the various and apparently arbitrary manner in which the
King interfered to regulate the nuptial contracts among his
subjeetS. But even this sketch will be sufficient to show that
a valuable addition is here made to the collection of contem-
porary documents submitted to the historian3 a gradually
accumulating mass, by the aid of which we may hope at
length to see something of the certainty of scienee given to
the early history of the English nation. ι

In form the Chancellor’s rolls do not differ from those of
the Pipe. Each roll is composed of a number of smaller rolls
stitebed together along the head, and each of these usually
consists of two membranas, The entries are on both sides.
The three faesimiles which follow represent the character in
which the record is written, to which a fourth is added,
containing a portion of the accompts of the Honour of
Gloucester, representing the character used in the cor.
responding roll of. the Treasurer.
