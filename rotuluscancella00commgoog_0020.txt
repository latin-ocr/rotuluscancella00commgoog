PREFAC E. xiii

Of the manner in which these accompts were made up, of
the kind of information to be expected from them, whether
that direct information as being the official ,accompts of an
important branch of the Royal Revenue, or that indirect but
not less valuable information which they afford concerning the
state of society, the public eventS, and the eminent persons of
the time, and of the use which may be made of them for his·
torical, legal, or literary purposeS, a more suitable opportunity
of speaking will be afforded in a General Preface to the
intended Series of the Treasurer’s Rolls. NevertheleSS‚ as
this is the first of the Rotuli Annales of the Exchequer which
has ever been made public, it may seem proper to prefix a very
short notice of some of the more valuable information (chiefly
that which is incidental) to be obtained from it.
